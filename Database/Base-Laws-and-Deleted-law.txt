Many of its features, including the federal scheme, the office of the governor, the structure of the judiciary, and the division of legislative powers into Federal, Provincial, and Concurrent lists, served as a direct blueprint for the Constitution of India.

Year of Enactment: 1947.

Status: Repealed by Article 395 of the Constitution of India, 1950.

Description: This Act of the British Parliament partitioned British India into the two new independent Dominions of India and Pakistan. It ended British sovereignty over the Indian subcontinent and granted full legislative authority to the Constituent Assemblies of the two new countries.

It was a precursor to more comprehensive legislation and was eventually repealed and replaced by the 1986 Act, which provided a more extensive list of prohibited occupations and processes and also regulated the working conditions of children in non-prohibited areas.

9. The Forest (Conservation) Ordinance, 1980 [Historical Law]
Year of Enactment: 1980.

It made the prior approval of the Central Government mandatory for any State Government or other authority to de-reserve a reserved forest or use forest land for any non-forest purpose. The provisions of the Ordinance were soon enacted into a full-fledged law, The Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980, to give its measures permanent statutory backing.
