### ACT
TITLE: The Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (IEA)
TYPE: Historical
DESCRIPTION: |
  The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, was the foundational law governing the admissibility of evidence in Indian courts for over 150 years until its repeal on July 1, 2024. Drafted by Sir James Fitzjames Stephen, it provided a codified and uniform set of rules for all judicial proceedings.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  The Act was divided into three parts, 11 chapters, and 167 sections.   

  Relevancy of Facts (Part I): Detailed which facts are considered relevant and may be proved in a legal proceeding. This included facts forming part of the same transaction (res gestae), facts showing motive or preparation, and admissions and confessions.   

  On Proof (Part II): Classified evidence as oral and documentary. It laid down the principle that documents must be proved by primary evidence (the original document itself), with secondary evidence being admissible only in specific circumstances.   

  Production and Effect of Evidence (Part III): Dealt with the burden of proof, estoppel, and the examination of witnesses.
TERMINOLOGY:
  - Evidence :: Defined to include (1) all statements which the court permits or requires to be made before it by witnesses (oral evidence); and (2) all documents produced for the inspection of the court (documentary evidence).
  - Fact in Issue :: Any fact from which, either by itself or in connection with other facts, the existence, non-existence, nature, or extent of any right, liability, or disability asserted or denied in any suit or proceeding, necessarily follows.
  - Relevant Fact :: A fact that is connected with a fact in issue in any of the ways referred to in the provisions of the Act.
  - Presumption :: An inference of fact drawn by the court. The Act distinguished between "may presume" (discretionary), "shall presume" (mandatory but rebuttable), and "conclusive proof" (irrebuttable).
