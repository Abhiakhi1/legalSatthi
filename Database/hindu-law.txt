### ACT
TITLE: The Hindu Marriage Act, 1955
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  This Act amends and codifies the law relating to marriage among Hindus. It introduced the concept of monogamy and divorce, which were not traditionally part of Hindu law, and established a uniform legal framework for marriage for all sections of Hindus.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  Conditions for a Hindu Marriage (Section 5): Lays down the conditions for a valid marriage, including monogamy (neither party has a living spouse), soundness of mind, and marriageable age (21 for the groom, 18 for the bride). It also prohibits marriages within the "degrees of prohibited relationship" and between "sapindas," unless custom permits.   

  Ceremonies for a Hindu Marriage (Section 7): Recognizes that a marriage may be solemnized in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party. It specifies that the marriage becomes complete and binding when the seventh step is taken before the sacred fire (Saptapadi).   

  Registration of Hindu Marriages (Section 8): Provides for the registration of Hindu marriages by State Governments to facilitate proof of marriage.   

  Restitution of Conjugal Rights (Section 9): Allows a spouse to petition the court for the restitution of conjugal rights if the other spouse has withdrawn from their society without reasonable excuse.   

  Judicial Separation (Section 10): Allows either party to seek a decree of judicial separation on specified grounds, which permits them to live separately without dissolving the marriage.   

  Divorce (Section 13): Lists the grounds for divorce, including adultery, cruelty, desertion, conversion to another religion, and incurable unsoundness of mind.

  Divorce by Mutual Consent (Section 13B): Allows for divorce by mutual consent if the parties have been living separately for one year or more and mutually agree that the marriage should be dissolved.

### ACT
TITLE: The Hindu Succession Act, 1956
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  This Act amends and codifies the law relating to intestate (unwilled) succession among Hindus, Buddhists, Jains, and Sikhs. It established a uniform and comprehensive system of inheritance and succession, significantly altering traditional Hindu law.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  Devolution of Interest in Coparcenary Property (Section 6): Originally, this section dealt with the devolution of interest in Mitakshara coparcenary property. The 2005 amendment revolutionized this by granting daughters the same rights as sons in coparcenary property by birth.

  General Rules of Succession in the Case of Males (Section 8): Provides that the property of a Hindu male dying intestate devolves first upon the heirs specified in Class I of the Schedule, then upon Class II heirs, then upon agnates, and finally upon cognates.   

  General Rules of Succession in the Case of Females (Section 15): Lays down the rules for the succession of property of a Hindu female dying intestate, with the order of heirs depending on the source from which she acquired the property.   

  Full Ownership for Female Hindus (Section 14): Abolished the concept of a "limited estate" for Hindu women, providing that any property possessed by a female Hindu is to be held by her as her full owner and not as a limited owner.   

  Disqualifications from Inheritance (Sections 25-28): Specifies certain disqualifications, such as a murderer being disqualified from inheriting the property of the person murdered.
