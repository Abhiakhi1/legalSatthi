### ACT
TITLE: The Administrative Tribunals Act, 1985
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  This Act was passed by Parliament under the enabling provision of Article 323-A of the Constitution. It provides for the establishment of administrative tribunals to adjudicate disputes and complaints concerning the recruitment and conditions of service of persons appointed to public services and posts in connection with the affairs of the Union or of any State. The primary goal was to provide a specialized and speedy forum for service matters, reducing the burden on regular courts.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  Establishment of Tribunals (Section 4): Provides for the establishment of the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) for Union government employees and State Administrative Tribunals (SATs) for state government employees upon request from the respective state government.   

  Jurisdiction (Sections 14 & 15): The tribunals exercise original jurisdiction over all service matters of public servants. This jurisdiction was initially intended to exclude that of all courts except the Supreme Court, but a landmark Supreme Court judgment (L. Chandra Kumar v. Union of India) later held that the jurisdiction of High Courts under Articles 226 and 227 could not be excluded.   

  Composition (Section 5): Benches of the tribunal consist of a Judicial Member and an Administrative Member, ensuring a blend of legal and administrative expertise.   

  Procedure (Section 22): Tribunals are not bound by the strict procedures of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, or the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. They are guided by the principles of natural justice, which allows for more flexible and speedier proceedings.
