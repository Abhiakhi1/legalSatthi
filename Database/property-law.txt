### ACT
TITLE: The Transfer of Property Act, 1882
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  This is the principal legislation in India that regulates the transfer of property between living persons (inter vivos). It provides a systematic and uniform law for the transfer of immovable property by acts of parties and covers various modes of transfer such as sale, mortgage, lease, exchange, and gift.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  Definition of Transfer of Property (Section 5): Defines transfer of property as an act by which a living person conveys property, in present or in future, to one or more other living persons, or to himself.   

  What may be Transferred (Section 6): Establishes the general rule that property of any kind may be transferred, but lists specific exceptions, such as the chance of an heir-apparent succeeding to an estate (spes successionis), a mere right to sue, or a public office.   

  Rule Against Perpetuity (Section 14): Prevents the tying up of property for an indefinite period. It provides that no transfer of property can create an interest which is to take effect after the lifetime of one or more persons living at the date of such transfer, and the minority of some person who shall be in existence at the expiration of that period.
