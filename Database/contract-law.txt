### ACT
TITLE: The Indian Contract Act, 1872
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  This is the principal legislation that governs contracts in India. It defines the principles of contract formation, performance, breach, and remedies. It applies to all states of India and is the bedrock of mercantile law in the country.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  Formation of a Contract (Sections 3-10): Outlines the essential elements of a valid contract: offer and acceptance, lawful consideration, lawful object, competent parties, and free consent. An agreement becomes a contract only when it is enforceable by law.   

  Void and Voidable Contracts (Sections 10-30): Distinguishes between agreements that are void ab initio (e.g., an agreement with an unlawful object) and contracts that are voidable at the option of one party (e.g., a contract entered into under coercion or fraud).

  Performance of Contracts (Sections 37-67): Details the obligations of parties to perform their respective promises and the rules regarding the time and place of performance.

  Breach of Contract and Remedies (Sections 73-75): Lays down the remedies available to the aggrieved party in case of a breach, primarily compensation for loss or damage caused by the breach.

  Specific Contracts (Sections 124-238): Contains provisions for specific types of contracts, including contracts of indemnity and guarantee, bailment and pledge, and agency.
AMENDMENTS: |

TERMINOLOGY:
  - Contract :: An agreement enforceable by law.
  - Agreement :: Every promise and every set of promises, forming the consideration for each other.
  - Consideration :: Something of value that is given by each party to a contract which induces them to enter into the agreement. It is the "quid pro quo" (something for something).

### ACT
TITLE: The Specific Relief Act, 1963
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  This Act is a remedial statute that provides for specific reliefs in civil cases. It operates on the principle that when monetary compensation is not an adequate remedy for the non-performance of a contract, the court may compel the defaulting party to perform the contract itself. It is supplemental to the Indian Contract Act, 1872.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  The Act provides for several types of specific relief:

  Recovering Possession of Property (Sections 5-8): Provides for the recovery of specific immovable and movable property.

  Specific Performance of Contracts (Sections 9-25): This is the core of the Act. It allows a court to order a party to perform their contractual obligations. The 2018 amendment made specific performance a general rule rather than an exception.

  Rectification of Instruments (Section 26): Allows for the correction of a written instrument if, through fraud or mutual mistake, it does not express the real intention of the parties.   

  Rescission of Contracts (Sections 27-30): Allows for the cancellation of a contract by the court in certain circumstances.   

  Cancellation of Instruments (Sections 31-33): Provides for the cancellation of a written instrument that is void or voidable against a person.

  Declaratory Decrees (Section 34): Allows a person entitled to any legal character or right to property to institute a suit for a declaration of their title.

  Injunctions (Sections 36-42): Provides for preventive relief through temporary and perpetual injunctions to prevent the breach of an obligation.
AMENDMENTS: |
  Related Amendments

  - Specific Performance :: A court-ordered remedy that requires precise fulfillment of a legal or contractual obligation when monetary damages are inappropriate or inadequate.

  - Rectification :: The judicial correction of a written instrument to make it conform to the true agreement or intention of the parties.
  - Rescission :: The unmaking or cancellation of a contract, which brings the parties back to the position they were in before the contract was made.
  - Declaratory Decree :: A binding judgment from a court defining the legal relationship between parties and their rights in a matter.

### ACT
TITLE: The Sale of Goods Act, 1930
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  This Act governs contracts relating to the sale of movable property ("goods"). It was originally a part of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 (from Section 76 to 123), but was separated to create a specialized law for commercial transactions involving goods.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  Contract of Sale (Section 4): Defines a "sale" (where property in goods is transferred immediately) and an "agreement to sell" (where transfer is to take place at a future time or subject to a condition).   

  Conditions and Warranties (Sections 11-17): Differentiates between a "condition" (a stipulation essential to the main purpose of the contract) and a "warranty" (a stipulation collateral to the main purpose). It also lays down implied conditions (e.g., as to title, description, quality, and fitness) and warranties.   

  Transfer of Property (Sections 18-26): Specifies the rules for determining when the ownership (property) of the goods passes from the seller to the buyer. This is crucial for determining who bears the risk of loss.

  Performance of the Contract (Sections 31-44): Lays down the duties of the seller to deliver the goods and the buyer to accept and pay for them.

  Rights of Unpaid Seller (Sections 45-54): Grants specific rights to a seller who has not been paid, including the right of lien (to retain possession of goods), the right of stoppage in transit, and the right of resale.

  - Agreement to Sell :: A contract where the transfer of property in the goods is to take place at a future time or subject to some condition to be fulfilled.
