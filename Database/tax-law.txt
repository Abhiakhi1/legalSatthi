### ACT
TITLE: The Constitutional Matrix of Indian Law: A Comprehensive Dataset and Analysis
TYPE: Unspecified

### ACT
TITLE: The Constitution of India, adopted on 26 November 1949 and effective from 26 January 1950, is the fons et origo—the source and origin—of the entire legal framework of the Republic of India.1 It is not merely a statute among others but the supreme legal authority that establishes, empowers, and limits the three organs of the state: the legislature, the executive, and the judiciary.3 Every law enacted, every executive action taken, and every judicial decision rendered must conform to its principles. This report is built upon this foundational premise, systematically tracing the diverse fields of Indian law back to their constitutional roots.
TYPE: Unspecified

### ACT
TITLE: The Constitution's supremacy is unequivocally declared in its Preamble, which has been described as the "soul of the Constitution".4 It outlines the core values of India as a Sovereign, Socialist, Secular, Democratic Republic, committed to securing for all its citizens Justice, Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity.5 The Preamble's opening and closing words, "We, the people... adopt, enact and give to ourselves this Constitution," signify that ultimate sovereignty resides with the people, who are the source of all authority.4
TYPE: Unspecified

### ACT
TITLE: The official Marathi translation, "भारतीय संविधानाची उद्देशिका" (Bharatiya Samvidhanachi Uddeshika), mirrors these profound commitments, establishing the foundational philosophy upon which the nation's governance is built.6 The Constitution establishes a parliamentary system of government that is federal in structure but with distinct unitary features, a crucial characteristic for understanding the distribution of powers.1

### ACT
TITLE: The journey of Indian constitutional law has been marked by a dynamic tension between parliamentary sovereignty and constitutional supremacy. This tension was ultimately resolved through the judicial innovation of the Basic Structure Doctrine. This doctrine, a profound contribution to global constitutionalism, posits that while Parliament has the power to amend the Constitution under Article 368, it cannot alter or destroy its fundamental features.
TYPE: Unspecified
RELATED_SECTIONS:
  - Article 368

### ACT
TITLE: The evolution of this doctrine reflects a compelling dialogue between the judiciary and the legislature. In the initial years post-independence, the judiciary, in cases like Shankari Prasad v. Union of India (1951) and Sajjan Singh v. State of Rajasthan (1965), upheld Parliament's unfettered power to amend any part of the Constitution, including Fundamental Rights. This deference was largely driven by the perceived necessity of socio-economic reforms, such as land redistribution, which required amending the right to property.17
TYPE: Unspecified

### ACT
TITLE: The power of Judicial Review, embedded in Articles 13, 32, and 226, is the mechanism through which the judiciary enforces constitutional supremacy. It allows the Supreme Court and High Courts to strike down any legislative or executive action found to be in violation of the Constitution, particularly the Fundamental Rights.3
TYPE: Unspecified
RELATED_SECTIONS:
  - Articles 13

### ACT
TITLE: The scope of this review was profoundly expanded by the Supreme Court in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978). This case established the "Golden Triangle," an inextricable link between Articles 14 (Right to Equality), 19 (Right to Freedom), and 21 (Right to Life and Personal Liberty).21 The Court held that the "procedure established by law" under Article 21 must not only be formally enacted but must also be "just, fair, and reasonable." A procedure that is arbitrary (violating Article 14) or imposes unreasonable restrictions (violating Article 19) cannot be considered a valid procedure at all.
