### ACT
TITLE: The legal landscape of India is not only defined by its current statutes but also by the laws it has repealed. This history is a narrative of the nation's evolution from a colonial entity to a sovereign republic, reflecting a continuous effort to align its legal framework with its constitutional ethos.
TYPE: Unspecified

### ACT
TITLE: The most significant recent development has been the replacement of the triumvirate of colonial criminal laws—the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (IPC), the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898/1973 (CrPC), and the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (IEA)—with the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, 2023 (BNS), the Bharatiya Nagarik Suraksha Sanhita, 2023 (BNSS), and the Bharatiya Sakshya Adhiniyam, 2023 (BSA) respectively.93 The original codes were drafted during the British Raj to consolidate law and establish imperial control.139 While they served as the bedrock of India's criminal justice system for over a century, their repeal represents a profound act of constitutional and political re-assertion, aiming to replace a framework designed for colonial administration with one that reflects indigenous values and modern realities.87

### ACT
TITLE: The Land Acquisition Act, 1894, was a quintessential colonial law designed to facilitate the acquisition of land for "public purposes," which often meant building railways, canals, and other infrastructure to serve British economic and administrative interests.246 The Act prioritized state power over individual rights, offering compensation that was often seen as inadequate and providing minimal provisions for the rehabilitation of displaced communities. This state-centric approach remained in force for decades after independence, creating a stark conflict with the constitutional guarantees of justice and dignity. The replacement of this Act with The Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013, marked a paradigm shift. The new law is framed in the language of rights, mandating social impact assessments, consent from affected families, and ensuring not just fair compensation but also comprehensive rehabilitation and resettlement, thereby aligning the law with the welfare state principles of the Constitution.246
