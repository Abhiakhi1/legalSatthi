  This Act governs the law relating to the divorce of persons professing the Christian religion. It also contains provisions for nullity of marriage, judicial separation, and restitution of conjugal rights.

  Grounds for Dissolution of Marriage (Section 10): Originally, the grounds for divorce were discriminatory, requiring a husband to prove only adultery, while a wife had to prove adultery coupled with another offense like cruelty or desertion.

  Divorce by Mutual Consent (Section 10A): The 2001 amendment introduced the provision for divorce by mutual consent, allowing parties to file a petition jointly if they have been living separately for a period of two years or more.

  Nullity of Marriage (Sections 18-21): Provides grounds on which a marriage can be declared null and void, such as impotence, prohibited degrees of relationship, or if either party was a lunatic or idiot at the time of marriage.
