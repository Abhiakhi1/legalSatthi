### ACT
TITLE: The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC)
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  The Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, is the primary procedural law that consolidates and amends the laws relating to the procedure of the Courts of Civil Judicature in India. It provides a comprehensive framework for all stages of a civil lawsuit, ensuring that disputes are adjudicated in a fair, orderly, and systematic manner.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  The CPC is uniquely structured into two parts: the main body containing 158 sections, which lay down the substantive principles of procedure, and the First Schedule, which contains 51 Orders and their corresponding Rules, detailing the specific procedures to be followed.   

  Jurisdiction of Courts (Sections 9-21): Section 9 grants civil courts the jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature unless expressly or impliedly barred. Other sections deal with principles like res judicata (Section 11), which prevents the re-litigation of a decided matter, and rules for determining the place of suing.   

  Institution of Suits (Order 4): A suit is instituted by presenting a plaint to the court.   

  Pleadings (Orders 6, 7, 8): These orders govern the drafting of pleadings, which are the formal written statements of the plaintiff (plaint) and the defendant (written statement) that form the basis of the suit.   

  Summons (Order 5): Details the procedure for issuing and serving summons on the defendant to ensure they are notified of the suit and have an opportunity to defend themselves.   

  Judgment and Decree (Order 20): After the case has been heard, the court pronounces a judgment, which is the statement of the grounds for the decision. This is followed by a decree, the formal expression of the adjudication.   

  Execution of Decrees (Order 21): This is the largest Order and provides the detailed procedure for enforcing a court's decree, including methods like attachment and sale of property or arrest and detention of the judgment-debtor.   

  Appeals, Reference, Review, and Revision (Parts VII & VIII): The Code provides mechanisms for challenging or reconsidering court decisions.
