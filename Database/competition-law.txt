### ACT
TITLE: The Competition Act, 2002
TYPE: Unspecified
DESCRIPTION: |
  This Act replaced the Monopolies and Restrictive Trade Practices Act, 1969 (MRTP Act). It aims to prevent practices that have an appreciable adverse effect on competition (AAEC) in India. The Act established the Competition Commission of India (CCI) as the regulatory body.
KEY_PROVISIONS: |
  The Act focuses on four main areas:

  Prohibition of Anti-Competitive Agreements (Section 3): Prohibits agreements between enterprises that cause or are likely to cause an AAEC in India. This includes horizontal agreements (between competitors) like price-fixing and bid-rigging cartels, and vertical agreements (between firms at different levels of the supply chain) like tie-in arrangements and exclusive supply agreements.   

  Prohibition of Abuse of Dominant Position (Section 4): Prohibits any enterprise or group from abusing its dominant position. Abuse includes imposing unfair or discriminatory prices or conditions, limiting production, or indulging in practices resulting in denial of market access.   

  Regulation of Combinations (Sections 5 & 6): Regulates mergers, acquisitions, and amalgamations (combinations) that exceed certain asset or turnover thresholds. Such combinations require prior notification and approval from the CCI to ensure they do not cause an AAEC.   

  Competition Advocacy (Section 49): Empowers the CCI to undertake competition advocacy, create public awareness, and impart training on competition issues.
